By submitting a pull request to this repository, you agree to the following terms:

1. **You grant OpenCongress a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
   irrevocable license** to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense
   your contributions under any license, including proprietary licenses.

2. **You confirm that you have the right** to grant this license for your
   contributions.

3. **You understand that your contributions are public** and that a record of
   the contribution (including your name and email) is maintained indefinitely.

4. **You understand that this project is dual-licensed.** The open source version
   is licensed under AGPL-3.0. The maintainers may also offer the software under

This agreement allows the project maintainers to offer the software under
both open source and commercial licenses, which supports the long-term
sustainability of the project.
